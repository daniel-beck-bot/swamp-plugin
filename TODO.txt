Jenkins Plugin TODO:

High Priority:
Fix the plugin crashing after consecutive builds - this happens because the API times out between builds if not refreshed by entering the config page
Bring back the clean command, see post on https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/sd4scnvCYqc

Medium Priority:
Update the plugin with "All Tool" functionality specified by the CLI
Replace Hard-coded languages, and build systems with CLI calls

Low Priority:
Make a script to build / release the plugin
