== Intro:
This plugin allows you to submit SWAMP assessments during Jenkins builds.
The SWAMP assessment will use open source static analysis tools to test your source code for vulnerabilities and flaws.
For more information on the SWAMP, visit https://continuousassurance.org
For more information on Jenkins, visit https://jenkins.io/

== Prerequisites:
The usage of this plugin requires that you already have the following:

- A functional instance of Jenkins.
  If you do not have a Jenkins installation, go to https://jenkins.io to get
  Jenkins.
  A good tutorial for how to set it up is at
  http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jenkins/.
- A valid SWAMP account.
  If you do not have an account, go to https://continuousassurance.org to
  register.

== Install the Plugin
To use the SWAMP Assessment Plugin it must first be installed using either the
Jenkins plugin store, or using a .hpi file containing the plugin.

=== Install Using the Jenkins Plugin Store
The SWAMP Jenking Plugin can be installed directly from Jenkins using the on-line
plugins available within Jenkins using the following steps:

NOTE: Not available yet.

. Go to your Jenkins URL in a web browser
. Click _Manage Jenkins_ -> _Manage Plugins_
. Click the _Available_ tab
. Enter *SWAMP Plugin* in the search field at the top right of the page
. Click the install checkbox next to the SWAMP Plugin
. Click the _install without restart_ button
. Click the _Go back to the top page_ link

=== Install from a .hpi File
The SWAMP Jenkins plugin can be installed directly from
SWAMP.hpi file using the following steps:

. Aquire the SWAMP.hpi on your computer
. Go to your Jenkins URL in a web browser
. Click _Manage Jenkins_ -> _Manage Plugins_
. Click the _Advanced_ tab
. In the *_Upload Plugin_* section, click the Browse button and select the
  SWAMP.hpi file on your computer
. Click the _Upload_ button
. Click the _install without restart_ button
. Click the _Go back to the top page_ link

== Configure the SWAMP Jenkins Plugin
The SWAMP Jenkins Plugin must be configured before use.
This configuration is modified on the following web interface:

. Go to your Jenkins URL in a web browser 
. Click _Manage Jenkins_ -> _Configure System_
. Scroll to the SWAMP Configuration Section (near the bottom of the
  configuration page), and enter the following:

[width="80%",cols="1,3",options="header"]
|==========================
|Parameter | Description
2+|*Credentials*
|Swamp Username a| Your username to log into the SWAMP

NOTE: Third party credential such as github are not supported by the SWMAP Jenkins Plugin
at this time.
|Swamp Password | Your password to log into the SWAMP
|SWAMP URL a| URL of SWAMP web site.
The default is the SWAMP public instance at https://swa-csaweb-pd-01.mir-swamp.org.

NOTE: _At this time the URL of the SWAMP web site can not be used.  The
URL of the backend server must be used.  See your SWAMP administrator for
this value if you are not using the SWAMP public instance._

|Test Connection Button | Use this button to test your credentials and URL
2+|*Global Project Settings*
|Default Project | The default project to be used for each upload
Can be modified in build settings
2+|*Miscellaneous Options*
|Verbose Mode | Provide extra output for status updates and error checking
|Run even if build fails? | If checked, the package will be uploaded and assessed even if the build fails
|Run Assessments in Background | If checked, the build will place the assessments in the background
you will not get any feedback of success/failure, but Jenkins build will complete without waiting for SWAMP assessments
|==========================

== Use the SWAMP Jenkins Plugin
. Go to your Jenkins URL in a web browser
. Click on the project link that you want to assess with the SWAMP
. Click on the _Configure_ link for the project on the left side
. Scroll to the *Post Build Actions* section (or click the _Post Build Actions_ tab)
. Click the _Add Post Build Action_ button and select "*Swamp Assessment*"
. In the SWAMP Assessment section, fill out the data as follows:

[width="80%",cols="1,3",options="header"]
|==========================
|Parameter | Description
2+|*Package Settings*
|Package Directory | If your source code for your package is located in a subdirectory, enter it here.
|Package Name | Enter the name of your package here.  This is the name that will be used in the SWAMP UI.
|Package Version a| Enter the version string of your package.
Every build should have a unique version String. The following macros may be used

[horizontal]
$build:: unique Jenkins build id
$date:: current date
$git:: most recent git commit id
$svn:: most recent svn commit id

If you do not update the version number each build (either using any of the above options or manually updating the version) then submissions will have the same version and be difficult to destinguish in the user interface.
|Package Language | The language that your package uses.
2+|*Build Settings*
|Build System | Select the build system your project uses.
|Build Directory | Enter a value if your software needs to build in different directory than
the _Package Directory_.  The directory is relative this the _Package Directory_
|Build File |Leave blank if using a standard build file name for the select _Build System_
(i.e. _build.xml_ for Ant, _pom.xml_ for Maven, _Makefile_ for Make)
Enter a value if the build file is using a non standard name. The name is relative to the _Build Directory_.
|Build Target |If building your package requires a special build target, enter it here, otherwise leave blank
|Build Command |If your package requires a non-standard build command, enter it here, otherwise leave blank and the command will be determined by the _Build System_.
|Build Options |If your package requires options to passed to the build command, enter it
here (e.g. `--verbose --setInt 1`), otherwise leave blank.
Add multiple options separated by spaces as usual.
|Configuration Command |If your package requires a configuration command, enter it here. If left blank, the configuration will be called without a command.
|Configuration Options |If your package requires configuration options, enter them here similarly to the build options.
|Clean Command a|Enter the command to clean your build.
Leave blank to use the `[build-system] clean`
2+|*Assessment Settings*
|Project Name |The name of the project to use in the SWAMP.
2+|*Click _Add_ to configure the Tool and Platforms to use:*
|Tool |Select the tool you would like to use for this assessment.
|Platform |Select the platform you would like to use for this assessment.
2+|*Output Settings*
|Assessment Output Directory |Places the output of the assessments from the SWAMP in this directory from the workspace.

|==========================

== Running an Assessment
When you run a build through any method (i.e. build button, git hook, etc.), the SWAMP Jenkins Plugin will send the package to the SWAMP for assessment.
To view the status of your build, go to _your project_ -> _build *_ (listed on the left hand side, pick the most recent build) -> _console output_

== Viewing your Results

Results from the assessments are viewable in Jenkins on completion.
These results will be viewable in the source code, and will also be parsed into a graph.
This graph is configurable by clicking the _configure_ link beneath the graph.

Otherwise, the SWAMP web site can be used to view results of your assessments:

. Login to the SWAMP as normal.
. Click _Results_
. Click the checkbox next to the assessment results you would like to review
. Click _View Assessment Results_ button

== Developing the Plugin

If you have installed the source code, you will need a few other repositories installed to make the plugin compile properly.
- Java-CLI (https://github.com/mirswamp/java-cli.git) (use the CLI-with-dependencies.jar file)
- Scarf-IO (https://github.com/mirswamp/swamp-scarf-io.git)

Once you have these, you can configure an eclipse project (or whatever IDE you plan to use) with the dependencies located in the .m2 directory.

To create the project in Eclipse:
- Download the github repository https://github.com/mirswamp/swamp-jenkins-plugin.git
- Go to file -> import -> maven -> existing maven projects
- Enter the SWAMP Plugin repository
- Click Next and Finish

To configure the project in Eclipse:
- Run maven install on both the github repositories listed above to install them to the proper directories
- Right click the project directory and click properties
- Go to the Java build path tab
- Click _Add External Jars_
- Enter ~/.m2/repository/org/continuousassurance/swamp/java-cli/1.0-SNAPSHOT/java-cli-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
- Click _OK_
- Repeat with ~/.m2/repository/org/continuousassurance/scarf-io/1.0-SNAPSHOT/scarf-io-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
If done correctly, (most) compiler errors should go away (there may be some extras relating to messages.java)

To test any changes to the code:
- From the Plugin directory, run `mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dmaven.test.skip=true -Denforcer.skip=true`
- In your instance of Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins
- Select the _Advanced_ Tab
- Under *Upload Plugin* find the swamp.hpi file generated by your build command (should be the plugin directory/target/swamp.hpi)
- Click _Upload_
- NOTE: Every time a plugin is updated, you will need to restart Jenkins, so select the restart Jenkins checkbox and wait for a restart

== Layout of the Source Code
Different elements of the plugin are located in different locations of the plugin, so here is a general list of where to look for certian errors:

=== Issues with logging in
The login function is located within the DescriptorImpl.java class, but is called in various locations of the DescriptorImpl.java, SwampPostBuild.java, and AssessmentInfo classes

=== Issues with package submission / assessment submission
This is all done in the bulk of SwampPostBuild.java within the perform function.

=== Issues with parsing data for output
The parsing is called at the end of the perform function within SwampPostBuild.java, but most of the code executed is in the SwampParser.java class in the parse function.

=== Issues with generating graphs
These issues may be a bit harder to fix because there are a lot of nested functions to make this work properly. Start with Restults.java and work back through method trees to try to find where your issue is.

If you would like to create a new graph, add it to the list of graphs returned from the bottom of SwampProjectAction.java
